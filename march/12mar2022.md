march is already here and almost half way through

its been almost half a month since i've committed anything to this repo
i feel like this will just end up like my other failed projects
i don't want anymore failed projects now
it will be better if i don't take up any projects rather than orphaning them :(

anyways

in the past two weeks, i got some nice experience coding in javascript

Javascript feels like magic!
i can update, append or remove components from the DOM, without writing any HTML code!
that feels like magic
not having any experience in Vanilla JS and jumping right into Vue and React was not a very good idea, now i realise


i feel like i'm improving as a coder
my code is still bad, but not as bad as maybe a month ago
i can really feel it
this is how i write code now -
before writing, i assume that i've already written whatever is going in my head and if it is pleasant to read or if i can make some sense out of it, pretending that i don't know anything about the task that the code is associated to, only then i proceed with the writing part

i have drawn a handful of graphs using JSXGraph now
it is a wonderful library, and the documentation is great! i just feel like the documentation **structure** could have been better

apart from that, i've also started working on Rive
it is a wonderful tool using which you can make SVG animations and control them through JS!!

this, also feels like magic!

i am not working a lot on backend though
i'm mostly surrounded by frontend/devops tasks
to be honest, i may also be running away from it myself, because honestly, i suck at Java
i don't know anything
i cannot even write 2 lines of code in java without looking something up on the internet

this needs to change

let's hope i change it in the near future

nothing else for now i guess

my personal projects are rotting in my computer, yearning for even one bit of attention (pun intended)

i really wish to bring them back to life

tomorrow is a Sunday
let's see if i can make at least some progress on my personal projects

if i do, i'll be adding them to my tomorrow's journal (if i write it :( )

tata!
