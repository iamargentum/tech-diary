# hello world!

this is the first entry into my tech-diary/journal

i will probably be writing down my learnings and will be committing to this repo
i may alternatively commit some small projects too

i'm not sure how well i will follow this habit, but i'll try my best to not break it and commit something at least 3 times a week

i don't really know what the directory structure will look like

all the journal files will be written in markdwon (i guess?) as i'm getting good at it by writing docs at my current workplace

let's see how long i follow this habit

bye!
